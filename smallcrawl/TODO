Features:
        > Smarter management of 492 (too many requests) and similar HTTP responses requiring a wait period before continuing
        > Log of errors encountered
        > Respect robots.txt

Improvements:
        > Move crawl to iterative - don't want to exceed max stack depth on big sites
          - will require big changes to the way testing works...
        > Better variety of sites in test_system.py
        > More useful error repoting on test failures, particularly in test_system.py
        > Should we really visit http://test.com/link when we've already visited http://test.com/link/

Refactor:
        > Extract mock and compare pattern in test_crawler.py
        > Move expected assets and links for test pages out of code into page files

Fixes:
        > Complete test stubs in test_crawler.py
        > Add missing tests for get_page.py error throwing functionality
